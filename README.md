# The Truth is Out There - UFOs

## Background and Purpose

This project was asked of us in order to collect data on UFO sightings and upload them into a database in order to increase accessibility for searching by different parameters (date, city, state, country and shape). 

## Using the Database 

In order to use the database, you have to put in the relevant data (date, city, state, country, and/or shape) for your search on the left side. Depending on how many filters you add, the data table on the right with populate with all of the relevant data points. <br>

Recommendations and Issues

The most pressing concern about this dataset is how limited it is. It only surveys a small period of time in January 2010. In order to make the website more vast and intricate, I would recommend adding more data. Three other recommendations for this database would be to: 

1. Add links to other websites having to do with UFOs, such as https://www.history.com/ufo-stories or https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/declassified-documents/ufo/.
2. Clean up the text in the data file in order to present a more uniform text style 
3. Create a photo library with more images and stories surrounding UFOs.
